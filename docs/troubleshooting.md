# Troubleshooting

Common installation and runtime issues.

## macOS: VS Code click-to-focus focuses the wrong window

### Symptom

Clicking a notification activates VS Code but raises the wrong window (or the last-active window) instead of the project-specific one.

### Why it happens

VS Code window focus requires **Screen Recording** permission (macOS 10.15+) to read window titles across all Spaces. Without it, the binary falls back to plain app activation.

### Fix

On first use the binary requests Screen Recording access automatically — a macOS dialog will appear. If you dismissed it:

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording**
2. Enable access for the `claude-notifications` binary (or the terminal running Claude Code)
3. Click the notification again

Once granted, the correct VS Code window will be raised even if it is on a different Space.

## Ubuntu 24.04: `EXDEV: cross-device link not permitted` during `/plugin install`

### Symptom

Plugin installation fails with an error similar to:

```
EXDEV: cross-device link not permitted, rename '.../.claude/plugins/cache/...' -> '/tmp/claude-plugin-temp-...'
```

### Why it happens

Claude Code's plugin installer attempts to move a plugin directory from `~/.claude/...` into `/tmp/...` using `rename()`.
On many Linux systems (including Ubuntu 24.04), `/tmp` is mounted as `tmpfs` (a different filesystem/device), so cross-device `rename()` fails with `EXDEV`.

### Fix (recommended)

Set a temporary directory on the same filesystem as your `~/.claude` (usually under `$HOME`) and start Claude Code from that environment:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.claude/tmp"
TMPDIR="$HOME/.claude/tmp" claude
```

Then retry:

```text
/plugin install claude-notifications-go@claude-notifications-go
```

### Diagnostics (optional)

```bash
df -T "$HOME" /tmp
mount | grep -E ' on /tmp | on /home '
```

If `/tmp` is `tmpfs` (or otherwise on a different device) and `$HOME` is on `ext4/btrfs/...`, the error is expected without the `TMPDIR` workaround.

## Windows: install issues related to `%TEMP%` / `%TMP%` location

If your temp directory is on a different drive than your user profile (or where Claude stores plugin cache), you may see similar cross-device move issues.

### Fix

Make sure `%TEMP%` and `%TMP%` point to a directory on the same drive as `%USERPROFILE%` (or where Claude stores its plugin directories), then restart your terminal/app.

## Windows / Git Bash: binary download fails from GitHub Releases

### Symptom

Bootstrap or `/claude-notifications-go:init` installs the plugin itself, but downloading `claude-notifications-windows-amd64.exe` fails with an empty or generic network error.

### Why it happens

`raw.githubusercontent.com` and `github.com` may still work, but release assets are served from GitHub's release CDN. On corporate Windows machines, Git Bash `curl` often fails there because of:

- Proxy authentication or missing proxy environment variables
- TLS inspection with an untrusted corporate root CA
- Schannel certificate revocation checks blocking the request

### What to check

1. If your company requires a proxy, make sure the terminal running Claude Code or bootstrap has `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, or `ALL_PROXY` configured.
2. If your network inspects TLS traffic, ensure Git Bash `curl` trusts the corporate CA certificate.
3. Retry from another network or from WSL to confirm whether the issue is network-specific.
4. As a fallback, open the latest release page, download `claude-notifications-windows-amd64.exe`, place it into the plugin `bin` directory, and then re-run `/claude-notifications-go:init`.
